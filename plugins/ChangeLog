Release 20100322
----------------
 * Adding generic IPMI check (tests all sensors). Known to work with Dell and
   Sun systems, unsure on others. IPMI is only supported over the "lan"
   interface and tends to be quite slow.
 * Cleaned up code for "use strict" flag.
   (Thanks to Jean-Francois Panisset)
 * Minor fixes/modifications to help texts.
 * Changes to performance data output to better support data collection when
   Nagios itself is embedded in other products such as Centreon.
   (Thanks to Julien Breton)

   make it easier to read for non-HTML users (SMS reception, for example)
